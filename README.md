# hello-world
I am a beginner at programming. I have never learned anything about it before. In fact, I major in accounting at college. I think it's very cool to render a computer do tasks for us, like a magic. So I start to learn it. It's summer vacation and I have plenty time. I hope I can make some progress in this holiday!
